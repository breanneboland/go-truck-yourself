General API notes

To use a row identifier to look up a row, simply append it to the resource endpoint for that dataset. For example, to look up row 1 from the White House Visitor Records dataset using its row identifier:

    https://open.whitehouse.gov/resource/p86s-ychb/1.json?

In contrast, the USGS Earthquakes dataset is configured to use a publisher-specified identifier. To look up the earthquake with the ID 00388609:

    https://soda.demo.socrata.com/resource/4tka-6guv/00388609.json?

Heads Up! The order of the results of a query are not implicitly ordered, so if you're paging, make sure you provide an $order clause or at a minimum $order=:id. That will guarantee that the order of your results will be stable as you page through the dataset.

API endpoint: https://data.sfgov.org/resource/jjew-r69b.json

Problem with this one: LOTS of overlapping entries with different times (weird ones, ten-minute slots or whatever) for the same permit. One way of dealing with this might be to do a search that captures just the unique ones, or bundles the times into one value that can be interpreted by meal (11 am - 1 pm slots = lunch, for instance). Applicant name may not be the same as the truck name (lots of catering). 

Advantages: includes day of the week; unique cart ID in permit number; includes addresses and various location details; includes truck description text (little rote, but useful); created and modified dates; x/y and lat/long. 

Needs: to be able to collapse entries that duplicate company and location without losing unique information possibly available in each row - the key may be a combination of business name, location ID, and cnn. 

DayOrder
Numeric code for day of week
DayOfWeekStr
String value of day of week
starttime

endtime
This and former both rather arbitrary and unhelpful
Wait: combine this into a single piece of information and use it to fill out times - pluck first time and last for a single to provide start and end times. Inspiration: those PDFs attached to the map view entries
    Structure: Day > Address > Hours in a list
    Use to create range of hours
    Could also collapse multiple instances of a truck onto individual truck page, then present hours open at each location on each day
    Text for individual day, or more visual view for whole week, maybe kind of like Google calendar.

Can includes times as well as detailed truck location information

Food type details; could be reprintable, may need formatting (some spaces missing after punctuation)

Setup location

Looks like the unique key for this table
start24
More inaccurate-looking setup/opening information, but considering 24-hour time used, may be better option for guessing at meals served
end24
See above

This and lot: city-specific location information, I think. See if map API will use.

Mobile Food Facility Permit: https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat

Pros: lists location address, not admin address; states truck or food cart; location ID may be unique on this one and ties to pretty specific blocks/addresses; 

Less than pro: permit IDs are not unique in this db; no time information

Need: sort out all expired;

Mobile Food Permit Map: https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Permit-Map/px6q-wjh5

Uses schedule data; applies to map.
Their PDFs of schedule: quite good. Is there a way to extract schedule information or see how they use it to make those data pulls? Sample URL: http://bsm.sfdpw.org/PermitsTracker/reports/report.aspx?title=schedule&report=rptSchedule&params=permit=15MFF-0062&ExportPDF=1&Filename=15MFF-0062_schedule.pdf
