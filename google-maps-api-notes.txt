Google Maps API notes

Setup: http://www.w3schools.com/googleapi/google_maps_basic.asp
Need lat/long for centering - pull location from HTML5, default in the center of SF, wherever that is
Decide on zoom level

Markers for truck locations
Polygon for neighborhood delineations
Info windows for truck locations and possibly neighborhood map sections

    var marker=new google.maps.Marker({
      position:myCenter,
      icon:'pinkball.png'
      });

    marker.setMap(map);

Will need to create version of above function using database-supplied lat/long
No animation, ugh.
Icon bit lets you use a custom marker. Yes please.

Info window information: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/infowindows
W3 reference documentation: http://www.w3schools.com/googleapi/google_maps_ref.asp
Streetview parameters: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro

Options:
    Click the marker to zoom: http://www.w3schools.com/googleapi/google_maps_events.asp
    Click the marker for an info window: same URL as above

So the key seems to be to create a Jinja loop or something like it that turns out marker lat/long variables to be fed into the map on the page. And the search parameters would perhaps be set by the parameters/area covered by the map at loading or after zooming/shifting. 
45-degree zoom could be a thing, considering SF, considering tiny location markers.
